    ,,HAPPY NEW YEAR"<br>
    No more champagne
    And the fireworks are through
    Here we are, me and you
    Feeling lost and feeling blue
    It's the end of the party
    And the morning seems so grey
    So unlike yesterday
    Now's the time for us to say...<br>
    
    Happy new year
    Happy new year
    May we all have a vision now and then
    Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
    Happy new year
    Happy new year
    May we all have our hopes, our will to try
    If we don't we might as well lay down and die
    You and I<br>
    
    Sometimes I see
    How the brave new world arrives
    And I see how it thrives
    In the ashes of our lives
    Oh yes, man is a fool
    And he thinks he'll be okay
    Dragging on, feet of clay
    Never knowing he's astray
    Keeps on going anyway...<br>
    
    Happy new year
    Happy new year
    May we all have a vision now and then
    Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
    Happy new year
    Happy new year
    May we all have our hopes, our will to try
    If we don't we might as well lay down and die<br>
    You and I
    
    Seems to me now
    That the dreams we had before
    Are all dead, nothing more
    Than confetti on the floor
    It's the end of a decade
    In another ten years time
    Who can say what we'll find
    What lies waiting down the line
    In the end of eighty-nine...<br>
    
    Happy new year
    Happy new year
    May we all have a vision now and then
    Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
    Happy new year
    Happy new year
    May we all have our hopes, our will to try
    If we don't we might as well lay down and die
    You and I
